        level in most people.</p></li>
    <h3><li>   How long do blue Russian cats live?</h3>

        problems and are not prone to illness.<p></li>

        to a lot of trouble making. They do enjoying playing, but tend to be fairly mellow cats that are not
        extremely active.</p></li>
    <h3><li> Are Russian blue cats indoor cats?</h3>
      <p>A Russian Blue's coat is suited for cold weather so it can manage outdoors but its nature means that it is a
